## Infos
* A script which tell everything that does.
* Every command will be executed by you, it just prepare these for you to press the enter or modify it.
* It's like following the wiki but much faster.
* Balance between short and clean code.
* Commands separated into one location so you can easily modify it to your needs.

## Getting start
 * oneliner:<br/> 
 `curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aaronrancsik/altic/master/oneliner.sh && chmod +x oneliner.sh && ./oneliner.sh`
 * manually:
   * 1 Clone this repo and cd in
   * 2 `chmod +x setup.sh step_helper.sh`
   * 3 `./setup.sh`
  
## Motivation, goals
* Trying to keep the arch-way but faster.
* Every other project I found is hide the details ex. with TUI or silent for automation.
* I don't like all of these obscure, hundreds lines long, unreadable scripts which are do *something*.

  
## Contrib
This is a personal hobby project. I'm still pretty new to Linux and shell-script. Feel free to correct anything.
